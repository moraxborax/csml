# CSML
"CSML" stands for "CSML-Styled Markup Language". It originally means "CSS-Styled Markup Language", but i decided to turn it into a recursive acronym, hence its current name. 

It is heavily influenced by CSS and JSON, as seen from its name. It is meant to be a substitute for HTML and meant to be easier.
